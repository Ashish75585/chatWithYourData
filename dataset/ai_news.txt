Title: Microsoft backs its $3B AI push in India with public and private sector deals
Description: Microsoft announced a sweeping series of artificial intelligence partnerships across India’s core sectors on Wednesday, a day after pledging to invest $3 billion in the country over the next two years as it intensifies competition with rivals Google and Amazon.
The tech giant’s chief executive Satya Nadella (pictured above) unveiled agreements with five major organizations spanning railways, healthcare, financial services, manufacturing and education.
This includes an agreement with the Indian Ministry of Electronics and IT, as part of which Microsoft will contribute to the ministry’s IndiaAI Mission Datasets platform by supporting data collection and synthetic generation.
The company will also train 500,000 people in AI technologies by 2026, and the two will also establish an AI Center of Excellence, called AI Catalysts, to promote rural AI innovation and set up AI labs in 20 national skill training institutes.

Title: Nvidia CEO says his AI chips are improving faster than Moore’s Law
Description: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says the performance of his company’s AI chips is advancing faster than historical rates set by Moore’s Law, the rubric that drove computing progress for decades.
“Our systems are progressing way faster than Moore’s Law,” said Huang in an interview with TechCrunch on Tuesday, the morning after he delivered a keynote to a 10,000-person crowd at CES in Las Vegas.
Coined by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore in 1965, Moore’s Law predicted that the number of transistors on computer chips would roughly double every year, essentially doubling the performance of those chips. This prediction mostly panned out, and created rapid advances in capability and plummeting costs for decades.
In recent years, Moore’s Law has slowed down. However, Huang claims that Nvidia’s AI chips are moving at an accelerated pace of their own; the company says its latest data center superchip is more than 30x faster for running AI inference workloads than its previous generation.
“We can build the architecture, the chip, the system, the libraries, and the algorithms all at the same time,” said Huang. “If you do that, then you can move faster than Moore’s Law, because you can innovate across the entire stack.”
The bold claim from Nvidia’s CEO comes at a time when many are questioning whether AI’s progress has stalled. Leading AI labs — such as Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic — use Nvidia’s AI chips to train and run their AI models, and advancements to these chips would likely translate to further progress in AI model capabilities.
This isn’t the first time Huang has suggested Nvidia is surpassing Moore’s Law. On a podcast in November, Huang suggested the AI world is on pace for “hyper Moore’s Law.”

Title: Panasonic unveils an AI-powered wellness coach, powered by Anthropic’s Claude, at CES 2025
Description: At CES 2025 in Las Vegas, Panasonic unveiled its upcoming digital assistant, Umi, which offers families a personalized, AI-powered wellness coach. Created in partnership with Anthropic, Umi uses the Claude AI model to help families “care, coordinate, and connect” with each other, the company said.
More specifically, this involves an AI assistant that focuses on helping families create goals, like spending more time together or being more active, through an interactive interface, which also allows users to voice chat with Umi.
In a demo of Umi during the company’s CES keynote address on Tuesday, Umi was available in a mobile app where families could group chat with the AI, as well as set goals, create routines, manage tasks, and more.
The app could also be useful for caregivers of aging parents who want to keep up with how those older adults in their families are doing, even if they’re not always physically together, Panasonic pointed out. (The company is working with AARP on this aspect of the Umi platform.)
The AI coach, which is due to launch in the U.S. in 2025, will additionally integrate with a community of experts who will help people build healthy habits and create wellness routines. Panasonic is working with other wellness-focused partners including Aaptiv, Precision Nutrition, SleepScore Labs, Addition Wealth, Blue Apron, Calm, and more. These brands, a part of Panasonic Well’s Partner Collective, will be working with Umi and other future Panasonic Well businesses, the company said.
Meanwhile, the partnership between Anthropic and Panasonic not only provides access to the Claude AI for use in Panasonic’s consumer products, it also brings Claude to Panasonic’s workforce. The company said it will integrate Claude as a “strategic asset” with a focus on improving results in areas like customer service, sales, marketing, and coding.

Title: Delta Air Lines announces an AI-powered assistant in its mobile app and free onboard YouTube Premium and Music at CES 2025
Description: Over the last few years, Delta Air Lines’ presence has become a staple of CES, with the airline regularly hosting splashy keynotes. This year, the company has rented out the Sphere to announce its latest slate of updates. These include (can you guess it?) an AI-powered assistant in its app, as well as an updated in-flight entertainment system with 4K HDR displays and Bluetooth connectivity. Members of Delta’s SkyMiles frequent flier program will also soon get free access to YouTube Premium and YouTube Music on board the company’s planes. Delta announced these updates at CES 2025.
The new AI assistant, which Delta calls the Delta Concierge, will roll out over the course of the year. Users will be able to interact with it using voice or text. In this age of large language models, that’s not exactly groundbreaking, of course. The idea here is to offer proactive advice and guidance for fliers, starting with notifications about upcoming passport expirations and visa requirements. Looking ahead, the service will also offer destination-specific notifications about local weather, for example.
The Concierge will also offer guidance to bag drops, Delta’s Sky Clubs, and departure gates.
This all feels useful but also a bit underwhelming, and many of these new features feel more like tablestakes than massive innovations. Indeed, I’m pretty sure no AI is needed to check whether a flier’s passport is about to expire or to tell them where their connecting gate is.
The new seatback experience, which Delta describes as “the first cloud-based in-flight entertainment system,” will begin to roll out in 2026. It promises a major upgrade to existing systems with 4K HDR QLED displays, Bluetooth connectivity, and a 96-terabyte onboard storage system to store movies, TV shows, music, and more.
Here, too, it feels a bit like Delta is playing catchup. United’s ongoing fleet refresh already offers 4K displays and Bluetooth connectivity, for example. That system may not be cloud-connected, but I’m not sure that matters to fliers, especially once the entire United fleet becomes Starlink-enabled. So far, that won’t include free YouTube Premium and Music, which Delta plans to offer.
And because a CES keynote wouldn’t be a CES keynote without announcing a few ideas that aren’t likely to ever come to market, Delta also on Tuesday announced that it plans to work with Airbus in the next flight test phase of the fello’fly project. The idea here is to have planes fly in formation — similar to flocks of geese — to save energy. This project has been ongoing for a few years now. It’s a nifty concept, but it will take so many regulatory changes to put into reality that it’s unlikely to be used anytime soon.

Title: Sam Altman’s family responds to lawsuit alleging he sexually assaulted his sister
Description: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded to sexual assault accusations from his estranged younger sister on Tuesday, calling the claims “entirely untrue.”
According to the Saint Louis Post Dispatch, in a new lawsuit filed Monday, Annie Altman alleges her older brother sexually assaulted her over a nine-year period in the 1990s and 2000s. The suit echoes claims that Annie previously made on social media in 2021.
Sam Altman acknowledged the lawsuit in a post on X on Tuesday, responding with a statement from his brothers, Max and Jack, as well as his mother, Connie.
The Altman family alleges the lawsuit’s claims are false. They write that Annie has faced mental health challenges for several years and they are concerned about her well-being. The Altmans say they have tried to help Annie in many ways, including by financially supporting her for several years.
Sam Altman has long been estranged from his sister, according to a 2023 profile of the OpenAI CEO in New York Magazine. While Altman frequently talks about his brothers, who are themselves tech entrepreneurs and investors, he rarely mentions his sister publicly. At one point, per the New York Magazine profile, Annie asked him to repost her podcast, a request that Sam refused. The piece separately noted that Altman has repeatedly tried to offer Annie money, gifts, and even to buy her a house.
The profile piece echoes some of the concerns around Annie’s mental health that Altman described in his response to her accusations on Tuesday. It describes Annie as having an unstable personal life, noting that she once moved 20 times in a single year. The death of their father, Jerry, in 2018 was apparently a tipping point for Annie’s mental health.

Title: AWS says it’ll invest ‘at least’ $11B to expand data center infrastructure in Georgia
Description: On Tuesday, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Amazon’s cloud computing division, said that it plans to invest “at least” $11 billion in Georgia to expand its infrastructure to support various cloud computing and AI technologies.
AWS estimates that its investment will create roughly 550 jobs in the state.
“AWS is proud to expand our operations in Georgia to help drive the next generation of cutting-edge technologies such as AI,” the company wrote in a press release. “We’re grateful for the state and local leaders who have partnered with us, and we look forward to keeping Georgia at the leading edge of the digital age.”
AWS’ infusion comes about eight months after the company said it would pour the same amount of cash — $11 billion — into data centers in Indiana. That deal will create at least 1,000 jobs, AWS pledged.
Georgia is becoming a popular site for data centers. According to one report, by midyear 2024, data center construction had increased 76% year-over-year in the Atlanta market alone.
The city’s cheap electricity, existing fiber-optic infrastructure, and state tax incentives are attractive to Big Tech. Google, Meta, Elon Musk’s X, and Microsoft are other major infrastructure spenders in the region. In 2023, Microsoft purchased hundreds of acres of land to build a data center expected to cost around $1.8 billion.
Locals aren’t necessarily pleased about the developments, which they say compete with housing and other more pressing real estate needs. Last September, Atlanta’s city council banned new data centers from opening in neighborhoods near transit and the popular Beltline walking trail.
Data centers also tend to have high power requirements. Utility Georgia Power is leaning in part on fossil fuels to generate enough capacity to power current and future data centers, a move that has been criticized by environmental advocates.
According to real estate data firm Green Street, by 2028, the Atlanta metro’s data center inventory could grow to a power load of over 4,000 megawatts — more than 30x the metro’s data center load in 2012.
The AI boom is responsible for driving many, if not most, of today’s data center expansion projects. AI requires lots of computing power to develop and run. Goldman Sachs estimates that AI will represent about 19% of data center power demand by 2028.
AI companies have shown a willingness to spend big. Microsoft recently said it was on track to invest $80 billion in AI data centers this year. Per a McKinsey report, capital spending on procurement and installation of mechanical and electrical systems for data centers could eclipse $250 billion in the next five years.

Title: Trump announces $20B plan to build new data centers in the US
Description: President-elect Donald Trump has announced that Hussain Sajwani, an Emirati billionaire businessman who founded the property development giant DAMAC Properties, will invest $20 billion in new data centers across the United States.
The first phase of the multi-year investment will fund data centers in Arizona, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Texas, Trump said during a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago home on Tuesday. The data centers will primarily support AI and cloud technologies.
“We’ve been waiting for years to increase our investments in the U.S.,” Sajwani said. “We’re trying to invest $20 billion, and [potentially] even more than that.”
No further details about the investment were disclosed during the press conference.
It’s important to note that the deal may amount to nothing. Similar investment pledges have fizzled out in the past. In 2017, then-President Trump and Wisconsin’s then-governor Scott Walker announced that Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn would spend $10 billion for a campus near Milwaukee. Within months, Foxconn began scaling back its plans. Wisconsin Public Radio reported that by the end of 2022, the chip giant created about 1,000 jobs in Wisconsin — far from the 13,000 it promised — and spent only $1 billion as of the beginning of 2023.
Trump has been a vocal critic of the CHIPS Act, one of the signature policy achievements of the outgoing Biden administration. The Act set aside $39 billion in grants, plus 25% tax credits and billions more in loans, to rejuvenate American semiconductor manufacturing after decades of production shifting to Asia.
Trump and other Republicans, including Mike Johnson (R-LA), who was narrowly reelected as House Speaker last week, have threatened to repeal the CHIPS Act. In an interview with Joe Rogan last October, Trump accused Taiwan of stealing “our chip business” and called for tariffs on imported semiconductors.
The CHIPS Act, which passed with bipartisan support in 2022, attracted investment from all five of the world’s top advanced chipmakers. Companies have pledged to spend more than 10 times the Act’s grant total, according to Bloomberg.
A number of tech leaders have called for the U.S. to up its investment in data center infrastructure, particularly as the AI industry continues to grow at an explosive pace. AI systems require enormous computing resources to develop and run at scale.
Microsoft, which recently said it was on track to spend $80 billion on AI data centers, said in a recent blog post penned by president Brad Smith that the company’s success depends on “new partnerships founded on large-scale infrastructure investments.”
“The United States is poised to stand at the forefront of this new technology wave, especially if it doubles down on its strengths and effectively partners internationally,” Smith wrote. “The incoming Administration can strengthen [its] foundational elements, building on the work from President Trump’s first term.”
In an interview with Bloomberg published Sunday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that there’s “a real opportunity” for the Trump administration to “to do something much better [than the CHIPS Act] as a follow-on.”
“I don’t think the Chips Act has been as effective as any of us hoped,” Altman said. “The thing I really deeply agree with [President Trump] on is, it is wild how difficult it has become to build things in the United States. Power plants, data centers, any of that kind of stuff. I understand how bureaucratic cruft builds up, but it’s not helpful to the country in general.”

Title: Microsoft plans to invest $3B in AI, cloud in India
Description: Microsoft plans to invest $3 billion to expand its artificial intelligence and cloud services in India.
The firm, which has been operating in India for more than two decades, will also train an additional 10 million people in the country with AI, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said at an event in Bengaluru on Tuesday.
“The investments in infrastructure and skilling we are announcing today reaffirm our commitment to making India AI-first, and will help ensure people and organizations across the country benefit broadly,” said Nadella. “The diffusion rate of AI in India is exciting.”
India is a key overseas market for U.S. tech giants that have poured billions into building and scaling their operations in the South Asian market as they work to court businesses serving millions of users.
The competition has intensified in recent quarters, as Microsoft aggressively augments its offerings with new AI capabilities. E-commerce group Amazon said in 2023 that it planned to invest $12.7 billion in its India business by 2030.
Microsoft, among the top cloud and AI providers in India, operates three data center regions in India and plans to make its fourth ready to go live next year, the company said. The $3 billion investment will be deployed to develop a scalable AI computing ecosystem to serve India’s AI startups and research community.
India has cemented its place on the global map as one of the world’s largest and fastest growing developer markets. More than 17 million developers in India use Microsoft’s GitHub. A number of tech executives, including Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang and AMD chief Lisa Su, have visited India in recent months, in part to court developers.
Microsoft also said it has signed an AI memorandum of understanding with SaaSBoomi, a community for B2B startups in India. As part of the collaboration, the two will seek to promote entrepreneurship in smaller Indian cities and towns, and attract an additional $1.5 billion in VC funding for Indian AI and SaaS startups.
Nadella said Microsoft is already seeing many of its Indian clients use its newest technologies. Some of its clients in the country include Infosys, Air India, Meesho, Tech Mahindra, Federal Bank, Apollo, MakeMyTrip, HCL Tech, Manipal, Icertis, and InMobi. IT firm Persistent is using Microsoft 365 Copilot’s “Contract Assist” to reduce negotiation times by 70%, Nadella said.

Title: Nvidia’s "Project Digits" is a ‘personal AI supercomputer’
Description: At CES 2025 in Las Vegas, Nvidia unveiled Project Digits, a “personal AI supercomputer” that provides access to the company’s Grace Blackwell hardware platform in a compact form factor.
“[Project Digits] runs the entire Nvidia AI stack — all of Nvidia software runs on this,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said onstage during a press conference on Monday. “It’s a cloud computing platform that sits on your desk … It’s even a workstation, if you like it to be.”
Designed for AI researchers, data scientists, and students, Project Digits packs Nvidia’s new GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip, which delivers up to a petaflop of computing performance for prototyping, fine-tuning, and running AI models.
Nvidia claims a single Project Digits unit can run models up to 200 billion parameters in size. Parameters roughly correspond to a model’s problem-solving skills, and models with more parameters generally perform better than those with fewer parameters.
The GB10, which was developed in partnership with MediaTek, features an Nvidia Blackwell GPU connected to a 20-core Nvidia Grace CPU. Inside the Project Digits enclosure, the chips are hooked up to a 128GB pool of memory and up to 4TB of flash storage.
Nvidia says that two Project Digits machines can be linked together to run up to 405-billion-parameter models, if a job calls for it. Project Digits can deliver a standalone experience, as alluded to earlier, or connect to a primary Windows or Mac PC.
But it’s not cheap. Project Digits machines, which run Nvidia’s Linux-based DGX OS, will be available starting in May from “top partners” for $3,000, the company said.
So it won’t be just anyone who can afford a Project Digits unit of their own. Huang thinks that there’s a market, however.
“With Project Digits, the Grace Blackwell Superchip comes to millions of developers,” he said in a statement. “Placing an AI supercomputer on the desks of every data scientist, AI researcher and student empowers them to engage and shape the age of AI.”

Title:Amazon's New AI Tool "Diffuse to Choose" Lets You Virtually Try Products In Any Setting
Description: Shopping online can often be a hit or miss because it's not easy to visualize products before you buy. Amazon is hoping to change this with the introduction of Diffuse to Choose (DTC), a new AI system that allows you to virtually try products in any environment.
In a new paper published by Amazon researchers, DTC allows shoppers to seamlessly blend product images into their personal photos. This creates a “Virtual Try-All” experience where items appear realistically integrated into the desired scene or setting.
“Recent diffusion models inherently contain a world model, rendering them suitable for this task within an inpainting context,” the paper explains. “However, traditional image-conditioned diffusion models often fail to capture the fine-grained details of products.”
The paper validates DTC on both proprietary and public datasets, demonstrating quantitative and qualitative advantages over Paint By Example, a popular diffusion-based inpainting technique. Importantly, DTC matches few-shot personalization methods without requiring per-product fine-tuning.
The practical implications of DTC are vast and varied. For consumers, it means the ability to place any item from an online store into their own living space or personal context, seeing how it fits and looks in real-time. This not only enhances the shopping experience but also aids in making more informed purchasing decisions. For retailers, it offers a new level of engagement with customers, potentially reducing return rates by providing a more accurate representation of products.
DTC addresses this by employing a novel diffusion-based image-conditioned inpainting model. This model uniquely balances fast inference with the retention of high-fidelity details, ensuring accurate semantic manipulations in any given scene. The use of a secondary U-Net Encoder to inject fine-grained details into the diffusion process is a key innovation here. This process involves masking the source image and inserting the reference image within the masked area, followed by a series of complex adaptations and alignments within the model.
Early examples show DTC realistically blending a range of products, from clothing to furniture and decor items. The coherent lighting and shadows make items appear truly present in their inserted scenes.

DTC also enables iterative virtual decorating and outfit building. Users can adjust masks to alter the clothing style, such as tucking in clothes or rolling up sleeves.. This flexibility positions DTC as an engaging platform for personalized ecommerce experiences.
